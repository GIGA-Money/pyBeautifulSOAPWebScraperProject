# pyBeautifulSOAPWebScraperProject
A course project to build a web scraper for a database. The objective is to create a web scraper with py beautiful soap and to use the extracted data as inserts into a local MySQL Database.
https://github.com/GIGA-Money/pyBeautifulSOUPWebScraperProject
use develop2 branch to view my material.
The current state still does not connect to a DB correctly, the mysqlLb solution to connect to the localhost db did not want to work on windows.

*Current state just gets the data from the link, and moves the data into a json file
